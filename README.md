The application manages your StreetFighterV's saves so you can easily switch accounts without having to click through all the menus and settings again.

How to use:
1. Run this application BEFORE starting SFV.
2. You can leave it running or you can run it once before starting the game.
It is very important to run it BEFORE starting the game or else the game will override the current save before it has time to sync.
